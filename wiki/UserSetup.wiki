= Maven Setup = 

This projects makes use of some libraries that are not readily available in public Maven repositories. Therefore we have set up a Maven repository which provides these libraries as well as releases of this project. To use this repository, follow [UkpMavenRepository these instructions].

= Eclipse Setup =

We use the following tools for development:

    * [http://eclipse.org/ Eclipse] 3.7 or higher. We recommend the _Eclipse Classic_ distribution.
    * [http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/ m2e] 1.0.100.20110804-1717 or higher.
        * available in the Eclipse "Install new software"

=== For Windows Users ===

*Note:* On your machine the Java path may be different, e.g. because you are using a localized Windows version it may be `C:\Programme\...` -or- because you may have a Java version other than 1.6.0.01.

   1 Edit your `eclipse.ini` and add/change the following lines (the `-vmargs` line should be present already):
{{{
-vm
C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.6.0_01/bin/javaw.exe
-vmargs
}}}
      * Make sure that the linebreaks are as shown above (the formatting is actually necessary)
   1 Open Eclipse
      * Open the *preferences *
      * Go to *Java -> Installed JREs*
      * Click *Search* and choose your Java directory
      * *Close* the preferences and *re-open* them
      * *Select* _jdk1.6.0_01_ as your JRE (this should match the entry you added in the eclipse.ini)
