#summary Setting up Eclipse for DKPro Core development

= Eclipse Setup =

We use the following tools for development:

    * [http://eclipse.org/ Eclipse] 3.5 or higher. We recommend the _Eclipse Classic_ distribution.
    * [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ Subclipse] 1.6.x
        * update site: `http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x`
    * [http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/ m2eclipse] 0.10.0 or higher.
        * update site: `http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e`
    * Maven SCM handler for Subclipse
        * update site: `http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e-extras`

=== For Windows Users ===

*Note:* On your machine the Java path may be different, e.g. because you are using a localized Windows version it may be =C:\Programme\...= -or- because you may have a Java version other than 1.6.0.01.

   1 Edit your eclipse.ini and add / change the following lines (the `-vmargs`line should be present already):
{{{
-vm
C:/Program Files/Java/jdk1.6.0_01/bin/javaw.exe
-vmargs
}}}
      * Make sure that the linebreaks are as shown above (the formatting is actually necessary)
   1 Open Eclipse
      * Open the *preferences *
      * Go to *Java -> Installed JREs*
      * Click *Search* and choose your Java directory
      * *Close* the preferences and *re-open* them
      * Select "jdk1.6.0_01" as your JRE (this should match the entry you added in the eclipse.ini)

= Checking out =

   * Open the *SVN Repositories* perspective in Eclipse (Menu -> Window -> Show View -> Other... -> SVN -> SVN Repositories)
   * *Add* a SVN repository with the URL `http://dkpro-core-asl.googlecode.com/svn/de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core-asl`
   * *Expand* the new repository node in the SVN Repositories view
   * Right-click on *trunk* and select *Check out as Maven project*
      * *Note:* if you do not see this menu item, make sure you have installed the _Maven SCM handler for Subclipse_.
   * (optional) Eclipse will create a large number of projects now. We recommend to group these projects into a _working set_:
      * Select *Next*
      * Check *Add project(s) to working set*
      * Click *More...*
      * Click *New...*
      * Double-click *Java*
      * Enter the working set name `DKPro Core ASL`
      * Click *Finish*
      * Click *OK*
      * Select the working set DKPro Core ASL`from the working set drop-down box
      * *Note:* when you are completely through with these and the following steps, remember to go to the Package Explorer view. There is a small triangular icon in its top right corner. Click on that and select Top Level Elements -> Working Sets.
   * Click *Finish*.

However, Eclipse displays them as projects at the same node level as uimafit-parent in the _Package Explorer_ view.
