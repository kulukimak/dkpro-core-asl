#summary Setting up Maven and Eclipse for DKPro Core development
#sidebar TableOfContents

= Basic setup =

   * Follow the [UserSetup user setup] instructions
   * Uncomment the line `<activeProfile>ukp-oss-releases</activeProfile>`
   * If you are in Eclipse, restart it

= Eclipse Setup =

We use the following tools for development:

    * [http://subclipse.tigris.org/ Subclipse] 1.6.x
        * update site: `http://subclipse.tigris.org/update_1.6.x`
    * Maven SCM handler for Subclipse
        * after installing m2e, go to Preferences -> Maven -> Discovery -> Open Catalog
        * search for "subclipse"

= Checking out =

   * Open the *SVN Repositories* perspective in Eclipse (Menu -> Window -> Show View -> Other... -> SVN -> SVN Repositories)
   * *Add* a SVN repository with the URL `http://dkpro-core-asl.googlecode.com/svn/de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core-asl`
   * *Expand* the new repository node in the SVN Repositories view
   * Right-click on *trunk* and select *Check out as Maven project*
      * *Note:* if you do not see this menu item, make sure you have installed the _Maven SCM handler for Subclipse_.
   * (optional) Eclipse will create a large number of projects now. We recommend to group these projects into a _working set_:
      * Select *Next*
      * Check *Add project(s) to working set*
      * Click *More...*
      * Click *New...*
      * Double-click *Java*
      * Enter the working set name `DKPro Core ASL`
      * Click *Finish*
      * Click *OK*
      * Select the working set DKPro Core ASL`from the working set drop-down box
      * *Note:* when you are completely through with these and the following steps, remember to go to the Package Explorer view. There is a small triangular icon in its top right corner. Click on that and select Top Level Elements -> Working Sets.
   * Click *Finish*.

However, Eclipse displays them as projects at the same node level as uimafit-parent in the _Package Explorer_ view.
