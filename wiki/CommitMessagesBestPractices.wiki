#summary How to use a Commit message to update an Issue.

= Recommended Practices for Commit Messages =

The following recommendations come from [http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/IssueTracker#Integration_with_version_control Google Code]:

It is helpful if code revisions are linked with the Issue that they address.  You can easily create this link by the format of your Commit message.

A Google Code commit message can contain up to three parts: 
   # the commit notes: a summary of the revision
   # (Newline, then) the Issue ID and any changes to the issue (update, fix/close, change of labels, etc.)
   # a message to be posted to the Issue



== Sample Commit Messages ==

been handled.  The remaining part of the issue has a clear work-around
and only affects a small number of users, so it is less important to fix.
