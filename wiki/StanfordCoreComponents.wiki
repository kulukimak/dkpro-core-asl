= Introduction =

This page describes processing a small paragraph with Stanford CoreNLP components (*!StanfordSegmenter*, *!StanfordNamedEntityRecognizer*, *!StanfordParser*) and writing out the *noun phrases* (NP) and *Named Entities* (NE) ocurring in the NPs into a file (CSV format), such as e.g.
  * *NP*   the new product of UKP Lab   *NE* UKP Lab
  * *NP*   the latest announcements in the news   *NE* -

= Pre-requisites =

Either, create a new Maven project or incorporate the following to your existing Maven project.

You'll need the following dependencies:

  * de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.stanford.namedentityrecognizer
  * de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.stanford.stanfordsegmenter

== !StanfordNamedEntityRecognizer == 

=== Types ===

Using the standard named entity recognizers for English there are three classes:

  * PERSON (e.g. "Anna")
  * ORGANIZATION (e.g. "UN")
  * LOCATION (e.g. "Berlin")

The corresponding UIMA annotation types are called "Person", "Organization" and "Location", from the package *de.tudarmstadt.ukp.dkpro.core.type.ner*.
